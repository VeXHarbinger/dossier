Are you a tab junkie with a lot of hobbies?  If you're like me, this happens to you ALL THE TIME:

* I feel like cooking tonight, let me open a bunch of recipes.
* Oh wait, I need to research the best kite to buy for this weekend's trip to the park.
* Yikes, there's a bunch of great links on Twitter.
* ... where did these 50 tabs come from, I wish I could group them up and/or quickly email a batch of them.  

Well, that's the idea. Pop down "Dossier", choose all your kite tabs, bundle them out of the window into one tab. DONE. Again for the recipes, and for managing the new Twitter links.  Now I have three tabs (which I'll ignore just as much as I did the original tabs), but in a nice managed set of three tabs.

# Installation

Download the extension (packed) from here: http://is.gd/a4PTJw

If outside Chrome, it will save to disk.

In Chrome, browser will ask you if you want to continue or discard, followed by an install popover. Choose install and dossier icon will appear in your address bar.  That's it, you're ready to go!

# Usage

Clicking on the address bar icon will open a list of tabs in the current window. All are selected by default, but you can uncheck and check to your heart's content (and/or use the select all/ select none to quickly hone down what you need). Optionally title your dossier list as well.

Once you've chosen the links you want to bundle, click one of the two bundle buttons.  The big one helps you slim down your tabs by closing those selected. The small one keeps them open, if you just want a quick list to copy or send to your email.

And that's it! A new dossier tab with the selected culprits is created in a nice clean list.

From here, you may want to quickly email them. Just hit the email button, and your default mail client will take it from there. Perhaps you're done being organized, and want them back in tabs in this window. Simple, just hit restore, and they will pop back into the window again. Lastly, you can delete this list (after confirming, as this action is not undoable).  

Next time you open the extension popover, you'll see you can see "Your Lists", which allows you to browse the lists you've created as many times as you choose until you delete them. They are saved in localStorage in your browser, so don't worry about those links being shared with a third party, its simply a convenience so you can list things up and save them for later!

Enjoy!
